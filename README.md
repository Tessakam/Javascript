## Structure

The file consists of 48 exercises, divided into 9 series.  
Don't be afraid of the number: most of these exercises are very short and focus on a particular aspect.  
The exercises follow one another in a logical _relatively_ way, but don't let one exercise stop you: go to the next, come back to it later.

Each exercise must be done.  
NOTE: **Note: ** The exercises in series 7 are a little more complex, worth a try: they are good syntheses of the progress made.
